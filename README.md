# Convex Hull Visualization

A Java application for visualizing various convex hull algorithms.

## Introduction

This Java application provides a graphical user interface to visualize different convex hull algorithms. It allows you to interactively add points, apply various convex hull algorithms, and see the results in real-time.

## Features

- Interactive GUI for adding points
- Implementation of various convex hull algorithms:
  - Graham Scan
  - Jarvis March
  - Brute Force
  - Quick Hull
  - Kirkpatrick's Algorithm
- Random point generation
- Reset functionality
- Execution time display

## Algorithms

### Graham Scan

The Graham Scan algorithm is implemented to find the convex hull of a set of points.

### Jarvis March

The Jarvis March algorithm (Gift Wrapping) is used to find the convex hull.

### Brute Force

A brute force algorithm is implemented for computing the convex hull.

### Quick Hull

The Quick Hull algorithm is implemented to find the convex hull.

### Kirkpatrick's Algorithm

Kirkpatrick's Algorithm is implemented for convex hull computation.

## Usage

- Click on the "Random Points" button to generate random points.
- Use the "Reset Points" button to clear all points.
- Apply different convex hull algorithms using respective buttons.
- View the execution time for each algorithm.


# Line Intersection Checker

## Overview

This Java application enables users to draw two lines on a graphical interface and perform intersection analysis using two different methods: slope comparison and counter-clockwise (CCW) check.

## Features

-  User-friendly Interface: Simple GUI for drawing two lines and observing their intersections.
- Slope Comparison**: Calculate slopes of the drawn lines and determine if they are parallel or intersect.
- CCW Check: Analyze the orientation of the lines using the counter-clockwise method.

## Usage

1. **Draw Lines**: Click and drag to draw two lines on the drawing panel.
2. **Slope Check**: Click the "Slope" button to calculate and display the result based on slope comparison.
3. **CCW Check**: Click the "CCW" button to analyze the orientation of the lines using the CCW method.
4. **Intersection Feedback**: The result of the checks will be displayed at the bottom of the interface.
